# State Legislator Data Collection

This respository is for the collection, organization, and visualization of data on state legislators. 

Currently the repo only uses [openstates](https://openstates.org/) data. Data from other sources (such as [FollowTheMoney](https://www.followthemoney.org/), the Census Bureau, and social media) will be added in the future. 

The code currently provides the ability to generate a postgres database for a given state containing openstates data.
